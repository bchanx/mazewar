Distributed implementation of mazewar with Ricart-Agrawala.

[Running the server]
./server.sh [port] (ex. ./server.sh 8888)

[Running a client]
./client.sh [username] [server hostname] [server port] (ex. ./client.sh Joe localhost 8888)

[Notes]
- Usernames must be unique, or else server rejects the registration request (this avoids multiple "Joe"'s in the game to decrease confusion)
- Server has a soft limit of 4 concurrent connections, but can be raised in the source code to any reasonable number beyond (MazewarServer.java)
- Server supports dynamic quitting and joining (user can join mid game and leave at any point), however scores for that individual client will be reset each time.
